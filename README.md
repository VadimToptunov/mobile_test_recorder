# Mobile Observe & Test Framework

**Intelligent Mobile Testing Platform** - Observe, Analyze, Automate

---

## Overview

Mobile Observe & Test Framework is a platform for automatic generation of mobile application tests based on observing real user behavior.

### What does it do?

1. **Observe** - Records QA engineer actions in a special build of the application
2. **Analyze** - Creates a semantic model of the application (screens, elements, transitions, APIs)
3. **Correlate** - Intelligently links UI events with API calls and navigation
4. **Generate** - Automatically generates Page Objects, API tests, and BDD scenarios
5. **Execute** - Runs tests on a clean build (without SDK)

### Key Benefits

- **Minimal Manual Work** - QA engineers just walk through scenarios, tests generate automatically
- **Intelligent Correlation** - Automatically discovers relationships between UI, API, and navigation
- **80-90% API Tests** - Fast and stable tests instead of slow UI
- **Cross-platform Selectors** - Android and iOS from single model
- **Smart Fallbacks** - Automatic handling of fragile locators
- **Complex Cases Support** - Swipe, WebView, dynamic UI, hierarchy capture

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+ (tested with 3.13.11)
- Android SDK (for demo app)
- Java 17+ (for Android)
- Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA
- Node.js (for mock backend, optional)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository (or navigate to existing)
cd mobile_test_recorder

# Create and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Or use the activation script
source activate.sh

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install CLI in editable mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
observe --help
observe info
```

### Build Demo App

```bash
# Open Android project
# File → Open → demo-app/android in Android Studio

# OR build from command line:
cd demo-app/android

# Build observe variant (with Observe SDK)
./gradlew assembleObserveDebug

# Build test variant (clean, for automation)
./gradlew assembleTestDebug

# Install on device/emulator
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/observe/debug/app-observe-debug.apk

# Run on connected device
./gradlew installObserveDebug
```

### Demo App Features

**Onboarding** - Swipeable welcome screens  
**Login** - Email/password authentication  
**KYC** - Document scanning with Regula SDK  
**Home** - Balance and quick actions  
 **Top-up** - Card top-up with WebView (coming soon)  
 **Send Money** - Transfer to friends (coming soon)

**Note:** KYC camera works best on real device. Use "Skip" button for emulator testing.

### Run Framework

```bash
# Initialize project
observe init --platform android

# Analyze source code (optional)
observe analyze android --source demo-app/android

# Start recording session
observe record start --device emulator-5554

# (Use the app - tap, swipe, input text)

# Stop recording
observe record stop

# Generate Page Objects
observe generate pages --output tests/pages/

# Generate tests
observe generate tests --output tests/
```
