# 🚀 Getting Started

Quick guide to start working with Mobile Observe & Test Framework

---

## ✅ What's Already Built

### 1. **Python Framework (40% complete)**
- ✅ Full CLI with all commands
- ✅ Complete data models (Pydantic)
- ✅ Project structure
- ⏳ Implementations (stubs, need full implementation)

### 2. **Android Demo App (30% complete)**
- ✅ Gradle project with 3 build variants
- ✅ Onboarding screens (swipeable)
- ✅ Login screen
- ✅ Home screen with transactions
- ⏳ Top-up flow with WebView (TODO)
- ⏳ Send money flow (TODO)

### 3. **Observe SDK (10% complete)**
- ✅ Project structure
- ✅ Core classes (SDK, Config, Session)
- ✅ Event system (EventBus, Event models)
- ✅ Observer stubs
- ⏳ Full implementation (TODO)

---

## 🏃 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Python Framework

```bash
cd /Users/vadimtoptunov/PycharmProjects/mobile_test_recorder

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
observe --help
```

**Expected output:**
```
🎯 Mobile Observe & Test Framework

Usage: observe [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Commands:
  init       - Initialize new observe project
  analyze    - Analyze source code (static analysis)
  record     - Record observe sessions
  generate   - Generate test code
  model      - App model operations
  info       - Show framework information
```

### Step 2: Try CLI Commands

```bash
# Create test project
observe init --platform android --output ./test-project

# See info
observe info
```

---

### Step 3: Open Android Project

```bash
# Open Android Studio
# File → Open → /Users/vadimtoptunov/PycharmProjects/mobile_test_recorder/demo-app/android
```

**In Android Studio:**
1. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
2. Select build variant: **observe** (View → Tool Windows → Build Variants)
3. Try to build: Build → Make Project

**Expected issues:**
- Some dependencies might need syncing
- Accompanist pager version might need adjustment
- This is normal for first build!

---

### Step 4: Fix Build Issues (if any)

Common fixes:

```kotlin
// If accompanist pager fails, try this in app/build.gradle.kts:
implementation("com.google.accompanist:accompanist-pager:0.30.1")
implementation("com.google.accompanist:accompanist-pager-indicators:0.30.1")

// Make sure compose BOM is correct:
implementation(platform("androidx.compose:compose-bom:2024.01.00"))
```

## 🎯 Next Steps (Development)

### Immediate (This week):
1. **Test what's built**
   - Run CLI commands
   - Build Android app
   - Fix any build issues

2. **Implement Observe SDK observers**
   - UIObserver - capture taps, swipes
   - NavigationObserver - track screens
   - NetworkObserver - intercept API calls

3. **Add Top-up WebView screen**
   - Amount input
   - WebView payment gateway
   - Success/Failure screens

### Week 2-3:
4. **Complete Event Store**
   - SQLite implementation
   - Event recording and replay

5. **Implement Correlation Engine**
   - Link UI actions to API calls
   - Build app model from events

6. **Start Code Generators**
   - Page Object generator
   - Basic test generation

---

## 🧪 Testing Current State

### Test Python CLI:
```bash
# Create project
observe init --platform android

# Check structure
ls -la ./config
ls -la ./models
ls -la ./tests
```

### Test Android App:
```bash
# Build observe variant
cd demo-app/android
./gradlew assembleObserveDebug

# Install on emulator (start emulator first)
adb devices
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/observe/debug/app-observe-debug.apk

# Check logs
adb logcat | grep ObserveSDK
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- **All code is in English** (except our conversation)
- **Build variants are working** (observe/test/prod)
- **Test tags are in place** for all UI elements
- **SDK structure is ready** for implementation
- **Project follows clean architecture**

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Gradle Sync Fails
**Solution:**
- Check Java version: `java -version` (should be 17+)
- Sync project: File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
- Invalidate caches: File → Invalidate Caches / Restart

### Issue 2: Compose Preview Not Working
**Solution:**
- This is normal for first setup
- Try building first: Build → Make Project
- Then refresh preview

### Issue 3: ObserveSDK Not Found
**Solution:**
- Make sure you selected **observe** build variant
- Clean and rebuild: Build → Clean Project → Rebuild

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use observe build variant** for development
2. **Check logs** with `adb logcat | grep FinDemo`
3. **Test incrementally** - one screen at a time
4. **Ask questions** if something is unclear!
